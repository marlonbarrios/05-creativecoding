An experiment in generative art and creative coding. Seven autonomous agents generate a morphing object sculpting and tangling time with all the colors of their own existence.

I have been fascinated by self-organizing systems and the possibilities of software to simulate them. 
Slowdown and watch.
It is always different and is changing forever.

Another experiment on making a dynamic logo generated by code in p5.js playing with sine waves structures in WEBGL

I created a generative animation inspired by the MotionDAO logo. I am totally into creative coding; it is much fun. This is generated by drawing oscillating waves (sine and cosine).
