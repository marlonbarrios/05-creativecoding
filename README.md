This is a collection with fun code art projects using p5.js exploring the relationship of form, time and space inspired by complex systems and generative design using P5.js and java Script.

Generative art refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system. An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist. In some cases the human creator may claim that the generative system represents their own artistic idea, and in others that the system takes on the role of the creator.

Creative coding is a type of computer programming in which the goal is to create something expressive instead of something functional. It is used to create live visuals and for VJing, as well as creating visual art and design, entertainment (e.g. video games), art installations, projections and projection mapping, sound art, advertising, product prototypes, and much more.

## Soft Spaces

![vertical-slitscan0 (3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90220317/176262436-fae55141-e366-46af-b217-3fd7be17dc70.png)

It is series of classic video processing algorithms that uses the webcam input as a source and the browser as a performance space; it helps us to rediscover the interactions of movement and perception augmented by computational systems and strategies. The space of the frame is choreographed and remapped in collaboration with user/performer. Soft Spaces represents the cognitive continuity of motion, software, interface design  and embodiment. They are invitations to create and compose inside computational spaces. How do the spaces make you move?"

## Generative Tools for Meta-creation

This series investigates the potential of generative and procedural drawing using motion based algorythims. It creates the posibility that each app becomes for its a tool for creativity and expression.

Expressive code manifesting the terror created by gun violence and supreme court law reversals in the US. I started trying to create 'firewoks' yest this is what ended.

## Wolfram Cellular Automata


Simple demonstration of a Wolfram 1-dimensional cellular automata.
When the system reaches bottom of the window, it restarts with a new ruleset
Mouse click restarts as well

## Flocking Bubbles


I am fascinated by complex systems. An array of particles is created when you click the mouse. The particles flock towards the mouse and and cluster around it. They are sensitive to the sound in the room. Press space bar to reset the system. Press P to take screenshot.

## Color Particles Fountains


A particle system is created in the canvas
and the particles are programmed to be attracted by the mouse.
On mouse click, more emitters are created in the clicked location of the canvas.
All particles are individually attracted by the 'gravity' of the mouse.
Pressing the space bar deletes the 'emitters' in order.
"e" resets the canvas.

## Seven Morphing Rainbows

An experiment in generative art and creative coding. Seven autonomous agents generate a morphing object sculpting and tangling time with all the colors of their own existence.
Reload the browser to get different initial conditions.
Click on the image to capture a unique moment in time (image).

## Abstracted Mycelium 1.

I have been fascinated by self-organizing systems and the possibilities of software to simulate them. 
Slowdown and watch.
It is always different and is changing forever.
You can load  and click when you like an image. It exports the image to you desktop.

## Dynamic Logo 2


Another experiment on making a dynamic logo generated by code in p5.js playing with sine waves structures in WEBGL

## Dynamic Logo 1


I created a generative animation inspired by the MotionDAO logo. I am totally into creative coding; it is much fun. This is generated by drawing oscillating waves (sine and cosine).

## Simple Fractal Tree

Simple interactive fractal tree. Move the mouse in the x axis and increase the angle of the branches (opening) and move the mouse on the Y axis to make the tree grow in size.
Recursion and mouse in interaction.

## It Takes Two to tangle

Interplay of a human agent (you) moving the bigger ellipse with the cursor creating a gravitational pull for the smaller circle (software agent) following rules of position, mass and acceleration and leaving traces. The closer they get, there is more gravitational force making the smaller ellipse orbiting around the larger circle. Dance with the cursor and 'follow each other". Reload to change the initial conditions. It takes two to tangle. Slow down and play.
